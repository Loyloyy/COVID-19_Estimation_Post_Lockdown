# COVID-19_Estimation_Post_Lockdown

### As this is an active project, I decided to only start sharing the kernel 14 days after the lockdown to show viable results (accuracy)

As someone who is always looking to stand out, I initially did not wanted to do any data analysis/machine learning on the ongoing COVID-19 situation as everyone out there were pushing out the same content. However, as my country was moving out of the circuit breaker (lockdown) phase, I was looking for kernels or websites looking to predict the daily cases post lockdown and to my astonishment, I could not find any! Nevertheless, I decided that this will be a great opportunity to start on a unique project which can further inspire others when their countries' lockdowns are lifted as well!

Data regarding new cases are taken from [this page](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). However, it should be noted with regards to this dataset that I only took the numbers for other countries, mainly Germany, Japan and South Korea as these coutries have lifted their lockdowna and will thus be more useful in predicting daily cases post lockdown. 

With regards to my country's local cases, I decided to compile and update the dataset daily instead as majority of the cases in my country come from foreign workers who are unfortunately stuck in their dormitories. Fortunately, there are several channels in Singapore reporting the number of local cases (outside dormitory) where I can easily input the numbers into the dataset.
